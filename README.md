# Grant-53
Node validator security framework

Develop a security framework for Casper staking nodes (for validators).  

Initially, we weâ€™ll perform a comprehensive in-depth audit, in which we'll collect data about the Casper staking nodes (e.g. configurations, operations, etc..), and perform vulnerability assessments, operating system and application security assessments, access controls assessment, and other compliance evaluations (in accordance with regional and international requirements). 

We will then test and implement robust and compliant security for the staking node, in order to develop a cloud-agnostic and storage-agnostic, repeatable and robust security framework to govern staking nodes, and effectively identify and remediate any issues directly or with mitigating controls.
